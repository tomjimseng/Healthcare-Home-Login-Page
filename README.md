##Introduction

This was a simple front-end project built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for the small icons next to each form text box. HTML was used to structure the project and build the framework for form data and navigation links. CSS was used to set the background image and style components that are more appealing to the user. Javascript was then created to check the login pages for form completion. The end product is the front navigation page for a Healthcare System Application. It navigates both staff and patients to their respective logins along with allowing for inquieries and scheduling appointments. Background images for the project were found at [Pexel](https://www.pexels.com/).
